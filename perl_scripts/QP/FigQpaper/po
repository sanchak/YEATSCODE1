 Metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) present a worrisome situation as they can degrade essentially all classes of β-lactams and are not susceptible to therapeutic β-lactamase inhibitors. In order to trace the evolutionary origin of this function, ﬁnding enzymes with the same catalytic activity or topology using structural and sequence alignment techniques is an worthwhile exercise. The MBL superfamily is the outcome of such an effort. Previous work in our group has established a modular method that detects active sites in proteins using spatial and electrostatic properties of the catalytic residues, which enabled us to unravel a promiscuous protease function in shrimp alkaline phosphatase. Spurred by the fact that alkaline phosphatases (AP), like MBLs, are metallo enzymes requiring zinc atoms, we queried them for MBL activity. Here we report that APs indeed have MBL activity. TODOCHELATORS. This has been experimentally veriﬁed in calf intestine AP and shrimp AP using microbiological and microiodometric assays. Interestingly, such promisicuity of the AP active site also leads to a competitive inhibition of its native phosphatase activity in the presence of ampicillin and penicillin. Since APs do not have signiﬁcant homology with any of the known classes of MBL (B1, B2 or B3), we propose to extend the classiﬁcation to B4 to include APs as the ﬁrst members of this new subclass.
