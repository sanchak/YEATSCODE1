\subsubsection{Predicting active site residues in PBPs and their relationships with $\beta$-lactamases:}
PBPs are a group of proteins that are characterized by their ability to bind penicillin, and not hydrolyze it. PBPs also shows a strong correlation in pairs of residues in the active site as seen in $\beta$-lactamases and serine proteases (SI Table~\ref{table:PBP}).
CLASP indicates a high degree of congruence to a particular PBP (PDB id: 2J7V) with the Class A $\beta$-lactamase motif (SI Fig~\ref{fig:2J7V}). This protein has all the sequence features of Class A $\beta$-lactamase but has a six-amino-acid deletion in the conserved $\Omega$-loop and also lacks the Glu166 known to be involved in the penicillin hydrolysis mechanism~\citep{PBP_BL}. CLASP detected the active site residues for this PBP as mentioned in the literature \{Ser61, Lys64, Ser122, Lys219\}.
Other classifications also point to this relationship~\citep{PFAM,DALI}. 
%CLASP takes a further step in predicting the active sites in this protein(Ser61,Lys64,Ser122,Lys219) (Fig~\ref{fig:2J7V}). 
These active sites are not predicted in CSA.
