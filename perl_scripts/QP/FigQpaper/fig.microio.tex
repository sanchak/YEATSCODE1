$\beta$-lactamase activity of APs as measured by microiodometry. Reactions were carried out overnight at $30\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$ at constant $\beta$-lactam concentration. Amount of decolorization of starch-iodine complex was measured at 620 nm with respect to control containing $\beta$-lactam antibiotic alone.
