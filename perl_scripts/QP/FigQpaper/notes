In subclass B2, as previously postulated by Vanhove et al. (34), Asn116 is not involved in the binding of the second metal ion, but the N116H (34) and N116H-N220G (2) mutants could have a reconstituted His116-His118-His196 site and behave similarly to B1 enzymes. Indeed, the N116H- N220G mutant has an extended substrate spectrum, and its dizinc form is active (2).  

In 2BGA, Arg121 is mutated to Cys121 - the potential difference deviate.

                                                                BJP-1 is a subclass B3 MBL determinant produced by Bradyrhizobium japonicum that exhibits interesting properties. BJP-1, like CAU-1 of Cau- lobacter vibrioides, overall poorly recognizes ␤-lactam substrates and shows an unusual substrate profile compared to other MBLs.  
Finally, and by contrast with other MBLs, BJP-1 was poorly susceptible to metal chelators, likely reflecting differences in the affinities of zinc ions for their respective binding sites.

Zn(II) is ubiquitous in nature, being the only metal ion present in enzymes from all six groups in the EC nomenclature (56). This fact highlights its amazing chemical versatility. In the case of M␤Ls, the Zn(II) ion is able to contribute to ␤-lactam hydrolysis by 1) lowering the pKa of a bound water molecule, which may act as a nucleophile, providing a high local concentration of hydroxide ions at neutral pH (37, 57); 2) acting as a Lewis acid, polarizing the CϭO bond and therefore augmenting the electrophilic nature of the carbonyl carbon (57); and 3) stabilizing a negative charge in the bridging nitrogen of the lactam moiety, after C–N bond cleavage (16, 17, 24, 36, 58, 59). These three roles have been invoked for the two metal binding sites in M␤Ls, 
Based on these observations, we propose a ␤-lactam hydrolysis mechanism for GOB, which does not require a metal-activated nucleophile (Fig. 4). Instead, the role of the metal ion is to steer substrate binding and to provide electrostatic stabilization of the anionic intermediate.
