To rule out any possibility of contamination in these commercial proteins, we purified it by gel elution of a single polypeptide band corresponding to the 
known size of these proteins from an 8\% Native PAGE gel by electroelution (Centrilutor micro-electroelutor from Millipore). 
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the purified proteins confirmed the presence of single polypeptides of the expected sizes.
(SI Fig~\ref{maldi}).
